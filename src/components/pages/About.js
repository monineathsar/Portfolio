                    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hello all! My name is Monineath (MOH-ni-neeth). I know, it is a
                        unique name, isn't it? My grandpa named me after the Queen of Cambodia.
                        This was already a rare name back in my home country, but after coming
                        to the U.S. at the age of 8, I realize this name was even more of "one-of-a-kind".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've lived in Minnesota ever since coming to the U.S.
                        You would think that I would've tolerated the winters pretty well after
                        spending most of my life with Minnesota cold temps (winter of 2020, temps
                        reached as cold as -30Â°F!). But nope, since my boyfriend, Rotha and I moved to San Jose in
                        March 2022, I've complained to him almost everyday that it's chilly here while completely
                        forgetting that we used to put up with snow in April in Minnesota.

                    <h3>Career Changes</h3>
                    <p>
                        I first finished my Associates degree in Dental Assisting in 2015. Dental assisting has high
                        mental and physical demands, just like most healthcare careers. After working in various
                        dental offices for a few years, I realized that this was not going to be a good long term
                        career for me. I was completely burned out by the third year in this field.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After dental assisting, I moved into a manufacturing line of work in the quality
                        assurance department. Starting off at an entry level position with QA Inspection, then
                        moving up into a QA Technician role 2 yrs later within the same company. However, I did not
                        feel fulfilled with this career path either. Although I was good at what I was doing, I
                        didn't think this job challenged me in the right way and I didn't find it engaging.

                <section id="why">
                    <h3>Why coding?</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the months leading up to the job offer, I saw Rotha worked hard in his studies to prepare
                        for interviews. It is a huge milestone for him to get this job offer, at least
                        to me. What's even cooler was the total compensation package he was offered.
                        Not going to lie; this was the biggest motivation for me to start coding too!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Money is not the only motivator for me, though. I have friends
                        who also does coding and they have always advocated for a career in the tech
                        industry every time I vented to them about my work. I've considered this
                        career path for years but I never felt the timing was right for me to pursue it seriously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since I had to quit my job in QA to move here with Rotha, I took this as a sign that it was
                        my chance to start a new chapter in my professional life. With the encouragement from Rotha
                        and his financial support, I felt that things were finally aligned for me put all my focus
                        into school so that I could be successful.
